## Algorithms Covered

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Simple and multiple linear regression models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multi-class logistic regression.
- **Decision Tree**: Decision tree classifier and regressor.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for classification and regression.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering**: Algorithm for clustering data into K groups.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Dendrogram-based clustering method.
